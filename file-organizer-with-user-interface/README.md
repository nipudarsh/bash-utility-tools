## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / 11 or Linux
- Git Bash installed (Windows)
- Python 3.x installed
- Flask installed

Check Python:
```bash
python --version
````

Install Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```

---

## ▶️ One-Click Startup (No Terminal)

### Step 1: Prepare Launcher Script

Create `start_app.sh` inside your project folder:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /c/path/to/auto-organizer
python app.py &
sleep 2
cmd.exe /c start http://localhost:5000
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x start_app.sh
```

---

### Step 2: Create Windows Desktop Shortcut

1. Right-click Desktop → New → Shortcut
2. **Target**:

```
"C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe" -c "cd /c/path/to/auto-organizer && ./start_app.sh"
```

3. Name: `Auto File Organizer`
4. Optional: change icon for desktop

Double-click icon → browser opens → app ready.

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the app in browser (auto-opens)
2. Paste the folder path (Git Bash format):

   ```
   /c/Users/YourName/Downloads
   ```
3. Click **Organize** → files move into categorized folders
4. Click **Recover** → files return to original locations

---

## 🔄 How Undo / Recovery Works

* Each move is logged in `logs/actions.log`
* `undo.sh` reads log in reverse order to restore files
* Log is cleared after recovery

✅ Fully reversible and safe

---

## 📝 Path Format Notes (Git Bash)

| Windows Path    | Git Bash Path   |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `C:\Users\Name` | `/c/Users/Name` |
| `D:\Projects`   | `/d/Projects`   |

Always use **absolute paths** to prevent errors.

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

* Downloads folder cleanup
* USB / pen-drive organization
* Media sorting (Videos, Images, Audio)
* Student project automation
* System scripting practice
* Cyber / DevOps portfolio demo

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

* Folder auto-monitoring
* Preview before organizing
* Desktop tray application
* Convert to `.exe` for Windows
* Full Python rewrite (no Bash)
* Authentication & access control
* Start / Stop buttons in UI

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Use **absolute paths only**
* Avoid using system root directories
* Ensure scripts are **executable**:

```bash
chmod +x organizer.sh undo.sh start_app.sh
```

* Check logs if recovery fails:

```bash
cat logs/actions.log
```
